## Day2: Planing the technical foundation.

There will be a product listing page where all products will be shown.
and a user friendly interface for browsing products as well as responsive for
both mobile and desktop screen.I want to create a single product page where user will go
if he intrested to watch full description of a product. The page contain selected product
name,quantity,description,price and variety if available.In this page there will be addTocart
button if user click this will add the selected product to UserCart.Where user can purchase it 
later.For Payment i will use a third party api strype.For shipment and tracking i use Shippo.
For schema i will add a pic to this folder where all my schema is defined.
oh i forgot about backend i will use sanity as my backend integration since i am currently not
familiar with backend services and i dont have database currently so sanity will fit best for me.
